## Motivation

[**CID**](https://github.com/ipld/cid) is a format for referencing content in distributed information systems, like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). 
It leverages [content addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage), [cryptographic hashing](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), and [self-describing formats](https://github.com/multiformats/multiformats). 
It is the core identifier used by [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [IPLD](https://ipld.io). 
It uses a [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) to indicate its version, making it fully self describing.

**You can read an in-depth discussion on why this format was needed in IPFS here: https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/130 (first post reproduced [here](./original-rfc.md))**

## What is it?

A CID is a self-describing content-addressed identifier. 
It uses cryptographic hashes to achieve content addressing. It uses several [multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/multiformats) to achieve flexible self-description, namely:
1. [multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash) to hash content addressed, and
2. [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) to type that addressed content,
to form a binary self-contained identifier, and optionally also
3. [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase) to encode that binary CID as a  string.

Concretely, it's a *typed* content address: a tuple of `(content-type, content-address)`.

## How does it work?

Current version: CIDv1

CIDv1 is a **binary** format composed of [unsigned varints](https://github.com/multiformats/unsigned-varint) prefixing a hash digest to form a self-describing "content address":

```text
<cidv1> ::= <CIDv1-multicodec><content-type-multicodec><content-multihash>
# or, expanded:
<cidv1> ::= <`0x01`, the code for `CIDv1`><another code from `ipld` entries in multicodec table that signals content type of data being addressed><multihash of addressed data>
```

Where

- `<multicodec-cidv1>` is a [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) representing the version of CID, here for upgradability purposes.
- `<multicodec-content-type>` is a [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec) code representing the content type or format of the data being addressed.
- `<multihash-content-address>` is a [multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash) value, which uses a registry of hash function abbreviations to prefix a cryptographic hash of the content being addressed, thus making it self-describing.

## Variant - Stringified Form

Since CIDs have many applications outside of binary-only contexts, a given CID may need to be base-encoded multiple ways for different consumers or for different transports. 
In such applications, CIDs are often expressed as a Unicode *string* rather than a bytestring, which adds a single code-point prefix. 
In these contexts, then, the full string form is:

```text
<cidv1> ::= <multibase-codec><multibase-encoding(<CIDv1-multicodec><multicodec><multihash>)>
```

Where

- `<multibase-codec>` is a [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase) prefix  (1 Unicode code point in length) that renders the base-encoded unicode string following it self-describing for simpler conversion back to binary.

## Variant - Human-Readable Form

It is often advantageous to translate a CID, which is already modular and self-describing, into a *human-readable* expansion of its self-describing parts, for purposes such as debugging, unit testing, and documentation. 
We can easily transform a Stringified CID to a "Human-Readable CID" by translating and segmenting its constituent parts as follows:

```text
<hr-cid> ::= <hr-mbc> "-" <hr-cid-mc> "-" <hr-mc> "-" <hr-mh>
```
Where each sub-component is replaced with its own human-readable form from the relevant registry:

- `<hr-mbc>` is the name of the multibase code (eg `z`--> `base58btc`)
- `<hr-cid-mc>` is the name of the multicodec for the version of CID used (eg `0x01` --> `cidv1`)
- `<hr-mc>` is the name of the multicodec code (eg `0x51` --> `cbor`)
- `<hr-mh>` is the name of the multihash code (eg `sha2-256-256`) followed by a final dash and the hash itself `-abcdef0123456789...`)

For example:

```text
# example CID
zb2rhe5P4gXftAwvA4eXQ5HJwsER2owDyS9sKaQRRVQPn93bA
# corresponding human readable CID
base58btc - cidv1 - raw - sha2-256-256-6e6ff7950a36187a801613426e858dce686cd7d7e3c0fc42ee0330072d245c95
```

## Design Considerations

CIDs design takes into account many difficult tradeoffs encountered while building [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech). These are mostly coming from the multiformats project.

- Compactness: CIDs are binary in nature to ensure these are as compact as possible, as they're meant to be part of longer path identifiers or URIs.
- Transport friendliness (or "copy-pastability"): CIDs are encoded with multibase to allow choosing the best base for transporting. For example, CIDs can be encoded into base58btc to yield shorter and easily-copy-pastable hashes.
- Versatility: CIDs are meant to be able to represent values of any format with any cryptographic hash.
- Avoid Lock-in: CIDs prevent lock-in to old, potentially-outdated decisions.
- Upgradability: CIDs encode a version to ensure the CID format itself can evolve.

## Versions

### CIDv0

CIDv0 is a backwards-compatible version, where:
- the `multibase` of the string representation is always `base58btc` and implicit (not written)
- the `multicodec` is always `dag-pb` and implicit (not written)
- the `cid-version` is always `cidv0` and implicit (not written)
- the `multihash` is written as is but is always a full (length 32) sha256 hash.

```text
cidv0 ::= <multihash-content-address>
```

### CIDv1

See the section: [How does it work?](#how-does-it-work)

```text
<cidv1> ::= <multibase-prefix><multicodec-cidv1><multicodec-content-type><multihash-content-address>
```

## Decoding Algorithm

To decode a CID, follow the following algorithm:

1. If it's a string (ASCII/UTF-8):
  * If it is 46 characters long and starts with `Qm...`, it's a CIDv0. Decode it as base58btc and continue to step 2.
  * Otherwise, decode it according to the multibase spec and:
    * If the first decoded byte is 0x12, return an error. CIDv0 CIDs may not be multibase encoded and there will be no CIDv18 (0x12 = 18) to prevent ambiguity with decoded CIDv0s.
    * Otherwise, you now have a binary CID. Continue to step 2.
2. Given a (binary) CID (`cid`):
   * If it's 34 bytes long with the leading bytes `[0x12, 0x20, ...]`, it's a CIDv0.
     * The CID's multihash is `cid`.
     * The CID's multicodec is DagProtobuf
     * The CID's version is 0.
   * Otherwise, let `N` be the first varint in `cid`. This is the CID's version.
     * If `N == 0x01` (CIDv1):
       * The CID's multicodec is the second varint in `cid`
       * The CID's multihash is the rest of the `cid` (after the second varint).
       * The CID's version is 1.
     * If `N == 0x02` (CIDv2), or `N == 0x03` (CIDv3), the CID version is reserved.
     * If `N` is equal to some other multicodec, the CID is malformed.

## FAQ

> **Q. I have questions on multicodec, multibase, or multihash.**

Please check their repositories: [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec), [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase), [multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash).

> **Q. Why does CID exist?**

We were using base58btc encoded multihashes in IPFS, and then we needed to switch formats to IPLD. 
We struggled with lots of problems of addressing data with different formats until we created CIDs. 
You can read the history of this format here: https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/130

> **Q. Is the use of multicodec similar to file extensions?**

Yes, kind of! like a file extension, the multicodec identifier establishes the format of the data. 
Unlike file extensions, these are in the middle of the identifier and not meant to be changed by users.
There is also a short table of supported formats.

> **Q. What formats (multicodec codes) does CID support?**

We are figuring this out at this time. 
It will likely be a subset of [multicodecs](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv) for secure distributed systems. 
So far, we want to address IPFS's UnixFS and raw blocks ([`dag-pb`](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-pb/spec/), [`raw`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.raw)), IPNS's [`libp2p-key`](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/RFC/0001-text-peerid-cid.md), and IPLD's [`dag-json`](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/spec/)/[`dag-cbor`](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-cbor/spec/) formats.

> **Q. What is the process for updating CID specification (e.g., adding a new version)?**

CIDs are a well established standard. 
IPFS uses CIDs for content-addressing and IPNS.
Making changes to such key protocol requires a careful review which should include feedback from implementers and stakeholders across ecosystem.

Due to this, changes to CID specification MUST be submitted as an improvement proposal to [ipfs/specs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/main/IPIP) repository (PR with [IPIP document](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/main/IPIP/0000-template.md)), and follow the IPIP process described there.
